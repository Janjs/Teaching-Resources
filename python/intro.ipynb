    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Python is a programming language. Like other languages, it gives us a way to communicate ideas. In the case of a programming language, these ideas are “commands” that people use to communicate with a computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "We convey our commands to the computer by writing them in a text file using a programming language. These files are called programs. Running a program means telling a computer to read the text file, translate it to the set of operations that it understands, and perform those actions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Popularity: https://madnight.github.io/githut/#/pull_requests/2020/4\n",
    "\n",
    "The Python programming language has a wide range of syntactical constructions, standard library functions, and interactive development environment features. Fortunately, you can ignore most of that; you just need to learn enough to write some handy little programs.\n",
    "\n",
    "You will, however, have to learn some basic programming concepts before you can do anything. Like a wizard in training, you might think these concepts seem arcane and tedious, but with some knowledge and practice, you’ll be able to command your computer like a magic wand and perform incredible feats.\n",
    "\n",
    "This chapter has a few examples that encourage you to type into the interactive shell, also called the REPL (Read-Evaluate-Print Loop), which lets you run (or execute) Python instructions one at a time and instantly shows you the results. Using the interactive shell is great for learning what basic Python instructions do, so give it a try as you follow along. You’ll remember the things you do much better than the things you only read.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Requirements\n",
    "* Have Python 3.5 or newer installed. You can check the version by typing `python3 --version` in your command line. You can download the latest Python version from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).\n",
    "* Have [Jupyter Notebook installed](http://jupyter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/install.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "If you can not access Python and/or Jupyter Notebook on your machine, you can still follow the web based materials. However, you should be able to use Jupyter Notebook in order to complete the exercises.\n",
